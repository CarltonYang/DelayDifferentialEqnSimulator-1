// In this file, we declare the X-Macro for the list of reactions to 
//   be simulated.  
// Each reaction must have a declared reaction rate function in 
//   model_impl.h
// For example, to declare three reactions named "one", "two", and "three", 
// use the syntax below
//#define LIST_OF_REACTIONS \
//  REACTION(one) \
//  REACTION(two) \
//  REACTION(three) \


#define LIST_OF_REACTIONS \
  REACTION(one) \
  REACTION(two) \
  REACTION(three)
